# doneWithIt

## Description

_Duration: Weekend assignmnet_

This is a simple app made to learn React Native. It follows the instructions given in the following video: React [Native Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-S5a0eXPoc). The app did start as a basic "Hello World" app but then I continued following the tutorial.

## Next Steps

The next steps I have for learning React Native is: 

1. To try to recode my Team zero Gaming app in it.
2. To find  a database that I can use with it and learn how to communicate with it.
3. To continue to learn development of the Team zero Gaming app in React Native.

## Technologies used

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- React Native
- Expo
- JavaScript

<!-- ## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
